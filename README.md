In this wiki I try to keep track of formulas that I have worked out at some point.

In writing them down I made use of Mermaid and LaTeX. GitHub doesn't render these properly. I use Visual Studio Code with the extensions installed that are recommend for this workspace (VS Code should give an automatic pop-up). You can then properly view the markdown files in VS Code.
